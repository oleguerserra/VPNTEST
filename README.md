# VPNTEST

In an environment where privacy and security are more important every day, there are some tools that are designed to protect us.

The purpose of a commercial VPN is to provide its users with secure and private Internet connections by encrypting data and routing it through remote servers, protecting online activities from third-party surveillance by protecting sensitive information.

From the perspective of a user concerned about his privacy, he would like to contribute in this field by researching and analyzing the main vulnerabilities of commercial VPNs today and proposing possible solutions to improve their security, providing ideas and recommendations on this topic .

These are the instructions provided in the README.md files for building the Android application and running the VPN test scripts. Please note that the instructions assume some prerequisite knowledge and assume that the necessary tools and dependencies are already installed on your system.
